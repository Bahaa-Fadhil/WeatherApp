### Getting Started

First, you must register at http://openweathermap.org/API . Follow the instructions on the page to get a API-key.

If you want to test the project clone project or download and run it on any local server.

Add your client ID where you find "var APIKey = 'WIRTE YOUR API-KEY HERE'; // YOU MOST USE YOUR OWN API-KEY IN THE APPLICATION, ELSE SHOULD NOT WORK !

```javascript
    var APIKey = '***********YOUR API-KEY HERE********'; 
    var URL = 'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?'; // Sending request to open weather API
  }
```
NB! some "fetch" does not work properly due to security between local server and HTTPS request. For example, it fails to retrieve icons
